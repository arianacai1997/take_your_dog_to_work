Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1

Output: 1

Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.

Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4

#### ideas:
和300一个道理, 但是因为difference被限定了，不能用替换的方法找，比如本来[2,5]被替换成[2,4]，而我们care这个end的数值+difference是不是=arr[i],\
所以无法用这个方法
