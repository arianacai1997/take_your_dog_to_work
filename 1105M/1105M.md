We have a sequence of books: the i-th book has thickness books[i][0] and height books[i][1].

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total width shelf_width.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is <= shelf_width), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.

 

Example 1:\
Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6\
Explanation:\
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.\
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.\

答案是copy的，一开始真的没思路，只能写出greedy的。后来看了答案，想不懂为什么要break。我儿子给我举了个栗子\
假设有5本书，标号1，2，3，4，5。3，4，5的宽度刚好够放下一层，现在4以下的摆放都知道最优解了，5放进来就只有三种情况
1. 5单独一层
2. 4，5一层，剩下的取3及以下的最优解
3. 3，4，5一层剩下取2以下的最优解
所以solution1这个loop是在考虑最上面那本书要和后面哪几本放一层。如果放不下了就break，后面这层再多加书更没戏\
sol2是从第一本往后面加，也就是说，加入5的时候，1～4都已经得到最优解，它是在看最后一层要怎么摆
